We want to send a marketing message to our existing home insurance customers whose policies are expiring in the next two months. The marketed message highlights how well Suncorp handled the recent natural disasters, in the hope this encourages those customers to renew their insurance with Suncorp. Given that some areas are still affected by those natural disasters, we do not want to send the marketing message to those areas.

You will find 2 files with this readme:

customers.csv - a list of the 50,000 customers whose policy expires in the next 2 months
blacklist.csv - a list of post codes that are still affected by natural disasters

You will write a program that accepts these files as arguments and produces a third csv file containing all the addresses from the customers.csv file that do not have a post code in the blacklist.csv file.
